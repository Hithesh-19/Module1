# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
```
a = (0==True)
b = (False==False)
c = (True+True)
d = (False+9)
print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c is",c)
print("d is",d)
```

## Result
Thus the Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts executed successfully.
